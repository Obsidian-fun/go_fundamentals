Producer-Consumer pattern (very useful for message queues - Kafka,RabbitMQ, etc.)

Produce() function which delivers the values needed by a Consume function.
Both could be run as a separate goroutine, Produce putting the values on a channel which is read
by Consume. The whole process could take place in an infinite loop:

for {
	Consume(Produce())
}
