/***
The context.WithCancel decorator function gets a context and returns another
context and a function called cancel . The returned context will be a copy of
the context that has a different done channel (the channel that marks that the
current context is done) that gets closed when the parent context does or
when the cancel function is called â€“ whatever happens first.

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background());
	time.AfterFunc(time.Second*5, cancel);
	done := ctx.Done();

// Notice how case<-done gets executed after 5 seconds,
