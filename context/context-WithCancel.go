/***
The context.WithCancel decorator function gets a context and returns another
context and a function called cancel . The returned context will be a copy of
the context that has a different done channel (the channel that marks that the
current context is done) that gets closed when the parent context does or
when the cancel function is called â€“ whatever happens first.
